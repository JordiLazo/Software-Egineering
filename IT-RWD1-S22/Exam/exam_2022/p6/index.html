    <h1>Create a box in HTML, style it in CSS, and make an animation that starts with a 1 second delay and then moves the box from the upper left corner of the screen to the lower left corner of the screen. When the box arrives at the lower left corner of the screen it should have a delay of 1 second before continuing to move the box to the lower right corner of the screen, have another delay of 1 second, then move to the upper right corner of the screen, have another delay, and then finally move back to the initial position (the upper left corner of the screen).  The illustration below shows how the box should move. The box should move in this square pattern continously and stay inside the screen at all times. (15 points)</h1>
